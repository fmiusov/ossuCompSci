# Algebra, al-Gabr

## Background Ideas

- real world vs. abstract (pure ideas and concepts)
- understanding abstraction
- abstract art is art that is not focused on trying to paint reality the way the real world represents is, a lot of times it is representative only of raw ideas, concepts, forms, etc
- Abstract is like the Platonic ideal
- Numbers, letters, and words are abstract symbols of quantities and ideas
  > Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols, in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language...without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.

- k/2 = 1/2k
- in 25k, 25 is the coefficient and k is the variable
- Linear equations center around the notion of equivalence or equivalent states
- Shift and rewrite statements in equivical ways in order to narrow down the truth of the unknown
- The key in linear equations is **preserving the equivalence**
- `x = 0` implies non-equivalence, thus `5x = 6x` is equivalent to `x = 0` in it's shared non-equivalence
- `x = 5` has one solution, `3 = 5` has no solutions, and `13 = 13` has infinite solutions
