## Background Ideas
- real world vs. abstract (pure ideas and concepts)
- understanding abstraction
- abstract art is art that is not focused on trying to paint reality the way the real world represents is, a lot of times it is representative only of raw ideas, concepts, forms, etc
- Abstract is like the Platonic ideal
- Numbers, letters, and words are abstract symbols of quantities and ideas
> Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols, in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language...without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.
